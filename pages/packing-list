# Personal packing list for research cruise
Last updated: Jun 18, 2024

## Required (adapted from UNOLS safety document):
- Sunblock and clothing that provide protection against the sun
- Warmer clothing for cooler nighttime temperatures and strong wind. Wool and polypropylene materials provide warmth and repel moisture. These materials also retain their insulating properties when wet. 
- Dressing in layers is a good plan to adapt to different thermal environments. Even on hot days, some spaces can be cold (cold rooms, electronics labs) or warm (spaces near engine rooms, servers).
- Head coverings for warmth and sun protection (e.g. beanie, baseball cap, buff)
- Sunglasses
- Comfortable footwear. Shoes should have nonslip soles, and steel toes are recommended (optional) for deck operations, cargo-handling, or other heavy jobs. Hiking boots/shoes are a good option. 
- Sandals are not permitted when working on a wet deck, near machinery, or in a laboratory (limit to sleeping quarters and restrooms, a.k.a. heads)
- Foul weather gear should include a jacket, pants, head covering, and waterproof footwear (for example, rubber boots). Wool socks are great here.
- Bring enough underclothing to last ten days without laundry facilities (but laundry can be run if needed). Laundry soap is typically available.
- Reusable water bottle
- Soap, hair care, shaving and hygiene products
- Medication â€“ prescriptions, seasickness medication (Dramamine), OTC medications you might use.
- Work gloves for handling wet lines - synthetic material for fast drying (inexpensive ones can be found at Home Depot or Ace)

## NOT required to bring:
- Bedding, pillows, warm blankets
- Food, snacks
- Towels

## Optional, can be nice:
- Book, headlamp to read in the dark.
- Music, audiobooks (save to your device before the cruise, no streaming due to limited bandwidth)
- Headphones
- Earplugs
- Favorite treats (chocolate goes a long way and is nice to share!)
- Small amount of cash to buy ship shirts
