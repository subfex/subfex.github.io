## Purpose

The field component of this project involves working aboard research vessels, which comes with unique challenges. The purpose of this code of conduct is to define guidelines that will make working at sea a rewarding experience for all team members. Clear communication of expectations and reporting pathways across all groups and institutions will help ensure a safe and successful project.

## Field setting and challenges

Field work in this project will include multi-day research cruises on a UNOLS vessel (R/V Robert Gordon Sproul, Scripps) and day trips on a smaller vessel (R/V T.L. Richards, Cal Poly).

Working at sea is a rewarding experience. However, it can also be challenging due to factors such as tight quarters, the possibility of seasickness, and being away from home for days-weeks at a time. Scientists are visitors on the research vessel and work with the resident technician and members of the crew. The remoteness and involvement of multiple institutions can complicate reporting procedures and prevention of issues such as sexual harassment and bias. 

## Expectations for all members of the science party

- We will prioritize safety and open communication above all else.
- We will familiarize ourselves with the Code of Conduct, or equivalent, at our own respective institutions and abide by them in the field.
- We will adhere to all policies of the vessel operators.
- We will treat everyone on the team and ship’s crew with respect, tolerance, and kindness regardless of academic rank, education level, or experience at sea.
- We will look out for one another and help if someone is seasick or having trouble adjusting to life at sea.
- We will take care of our own health and hygiene, get adequate rest, and come prepared with proper clothing (see p. 152 of the [UNOLS Research Vessel Safety Standards](https://www.unols.org/document/research-vessel-safety-standards-rvss) - Health and Medical).
- We will put safety first by paying attention during safety trainings and familiarizing ourselves with safety guidelines on pages 146-154 of the [UNOLS Research Vessel Safety Standards](https://www.unols.org/document/research-vessel-safety-standards-rvss) before going out to sea, especially those of us inexperienced at sea.
- We will ask questions if we are unsure of our responsibilities or what is happening in the science operations.
- We can and will decline if asked to do something we do not feel confident in or makes us feel unsafe.
- Sleeping quarters on the R/V Robert Gordon Sproul are dormitory-style with up to six occupants. Students and non-students will be assigned to sleep in different rooms. In shared quarters, we will allow other team members private time and space for changing or other matters of a personal nature. - - Sleeping attire should be appropriate for walking out into public hallways.
- We will not tolerate sexual harassment, including remarks of a sexual nature, lustful staring, and unwanted touching or physical contact.
- We will not tolerate discrimination of any kind.
- We will actively discourage exclusionary behavior like subtle comments about race, gender, sexuality, disability, or being part of any underrepresented group. Such behavior may be unconscious and as such may be addressed internally without formal reporting. Repeated exclusionary behavior after it has been addressed may rise to the level of harassment.
- We will maintain an alcohol- and drug-free environment at sea, as required on UNOLS research vessels. On shore, we will practice moderation if we are of legal drinking age and choose to consume alcohol.

## Expectations for PIs and mentors

- Before the cruise, make project team members aware of the science operations that will be happening at sea, safety considerations, and responsibilities.
- Check in with students and mentees daily to go over questions and feedback.
- Maintain clear and open communication with the resident technician, and ship’s crew as necessary.
- Ensure proper training of team members involved in science operations.
- Ensure that team members are aware of proper field gear and other items to bring before leaving.
- Look out for incidents of sexual harassment and bias.
- Intervene in incidents of sexual harassment and bias. PIs should participate in trainings on active bystander intervention, conflict resolution, and reporting through their institutions.
- Set a good example for students and mentees by fostering an environment of respect and collegiality among team members. 
- Provide feedback to students and other team members in a constructive manner.
- Review the Checklist To Promote Field Safety (Ackerman et al., 2023)

## Communication processes

- Bi-weekly team meetings will be used to prepare team members for field work and communicate safety considerations before cruises.
- PIs will maintain proactive and responsive communication with the vessel operator in a pre-cruise meeting and over email before each cruise.
- Each cruise will have a chief scientist (Connolly) who will coordinate science operations and serve as a primary point of contact with the resident technician, captain, and ship’s crew.
- PIs responsible for science operations (Walter, Mazzini) will actively coordinate with the chief scientist and resident technician, as well as the ship’s crew and captain as necessary.
- The chief scientist and PIs will coordinate the workload of scientists, ensuring that all participants have enough rest and that there is backup if a person cannot fulfill their assigned duties.
- Daily team meetings in the evenings on the ship will be used to plan for the next day’s operations, communicate feedback, and share science results.
- Any change of plans to science operations should be communicated to the PI in charge of the operation, resident technician, and chief scientist.
- PIs will check in with students and mentees at their institution daily. If a student, technician or post-doc does not have a PI from their institution on the cruise, they will check in with the chief scientist.
- If a sexual harassment or bias incident occurs, this should be communicated to the chief scientist or one of the PIs, who will respond in a discrete and appropriate manner to resolve the situation or help to formally report as necessary. The PI(s) will follow up to explain how the situation was dealt with.
- Formal reporting mechanisms are described below.
